					Fairy Gardens bring magic to our world, and remind us of the creativity and wonder of childhood. We recommend these as a special treat for those with children, or even to bring some whimsy to your own backyard! Each fairy garden is created uniquely, so each has different decorations and setup. Please request our catalog at our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to see what selections we have created. Remember, each is unique so once it's been purchased, it is no longer available. Will will also include an additional sheet to let you know which fairy gardens are no longer available, and this will be updated reguarly and sent upon request.
